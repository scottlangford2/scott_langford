excert: Extreme weather events are becoming more common and have significant health impacts on local residents. Injuries caused by these events may drive demand for pain-relieving medications.  In addition, the US remains in the midst of an opioid overdose crisis, with an unprecedented number of Americans relying on opioid use disorder (OUD) medications, such as buprenorphine, to manage symptoms of OUD. At the same time, inclement weather makes delivering supplies, such as medication, more challenging. This study evaluated the effects of extreme weather events on supplies of opioid medications. We used an event study model to demonstrate extreme weather events cause temporary decreases in shipments of several types of opioids: buprenorphine, methadone, hydrocodone, morphine and oxymorphone. These results indicate extreme weather events may disrupt treatment for OUD as well as for those experiencing extreme pain. These results point to an additional cost of extreme weather events: disruption of OUD and pain treatment.
