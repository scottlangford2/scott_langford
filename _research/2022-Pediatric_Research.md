excerpt: 'There is unmistakable evidence of increased NIH funding for pediatric and perinatal research, but there is much work to be done. To further promote NIH-funded pediatric and perinatal research, we advocate for a life-cycle approach in which the return on the investment continues over the lifespan. Although elected policymakers have short-time horizons, pediatric and perinatal researchers must provide novel evidence and theoretical arguments demonstrating the long-term health benefits for the adults of tomorrow by improving the health of our current pediatric populations. Child health researchers must communicate the role of early developmental events on childhood and adult disease, including those that are prenatal and gestational so that its importance is understood by the public and policymakers.'
