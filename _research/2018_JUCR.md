excerpt: 'Analogs for the substrates of aspartate semialdehyde dehydrogenase were prepared. Phosphonomethylcysteine, its sulfoxide, and its sulfone were synthesized starting from phosphonomethyltrifluoromethanesulfonic acid and cysteine. Phosphonomethylhomocysteine, its sulfoxide, and its sulfone were prepared in a similar manner. 2-Amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid, 2-amino-4-butanoic acid, were synthesized via the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction. S-Methylcysteinesulfone was synthesized by oxidation of S-methylcysteine. A bisubstrate analog was also synthesized, namely S-(3-(acetyl)pyridinyl) homocysteine. Most of these molecules are potential inhibitors of aspartate Î² -semialdehyde dehydrogenase.'
