I am an assistant professor at [Texas State University](https://www.txst.edu/) in the [Department of Political Science](https://www.polisci.txst.edu/) in the [Masters of Public Administration Program](https://www.polisci.txst.edu/graduate-programs/master-of-public-administration.html). I previously served as a post-doctoral research fellow in the [School of Public Affairs](https://spa.asu.edu/) at [Arizona State University](https://www.asu.edu/). I earned my PhD in [Public Policy](https://publicpolicy.unc.edu/) at the [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill](https://www.unc.edu/). The central goal of my career is to improve policy using a data-driven approach. I use policy and public administration theoretical frameworks, coupled with rigorous research designs, and advanced econometric methods, to answer policy-relevant questions. Substantively, my interests lie at the intersection of economics, public health, and the environment. I examine how economies react to shocks (e.g., hurricanes), and identify moderating conditions (e.g., entrepreneurship). My independent research has been funded by the [Kenan Institute for Private Enterprise](https://kenaninstitute.unc.edu/). My research has appeared in leading journals, such as the Journal of Business Venturing Insights, Economic Development Quarterly, the Journal of Regional Science, and JAMA Pediatrics,.
